\hspace{1 em} The principles of biometric authentication are not limited to humans. In fact, 
biometric authentication can be applied to a wide range of applications beyond 
human identification. For example, ships also have a 'biometric' signature. As presented in 
the podcast "Pavojai Baltijos jÅ«roje"\cite{podcast} navy ships have unique acoustic, electromagnetic
and pressure signatures. Based on these principles "smart" naval mines are being deployed in the contested waters.
These mines can identify the signature of a specific ship and detonate only when the target is identified.
