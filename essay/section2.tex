\hspace{1 em} Biometric authentication brings not only security and integrity but also convenience
to the everyday digital operations. From unlocking smartphones to enhancing surveillance systems, this technology offers unparalleled convenience. Nevertheless, ethical debates surrounding privacy invasion and potential biases in algorithmic decision-making underscore the need for responsible deployment and regulation.
\subsection{The good}
\hspace{1 em} Biggest advantage of biometric authentication - enhanced security. It is way harder
to steal a fingerprint or a face than a password. This brings second advantage - convenience. Biometric
authentication substitutes the need to remember passwords - also mitigates the risk of password getting compromised.

Accuracy of the operation - the fingerprint is more consistent than the same finger 
typing the password. This also brings the advantage of the speed of the operation -
it is faster to scan a fingerprint or look into a camera than to type a password.

Data integrity and accountabilty. Biometric data is inherently tied to an individual
, providing strong evidence of who performed 
a particular action, which can be crucial for accountability and legal purposes.

\subsection{The bad}
\hspace{1 em} There are some privacy concerns with biometric authentication. Biometric 
data is highly sensitive and personal, and its misuse can have serious consequences. 
For example, if a biometric database is hacked, it can lead to identity theft and
other forms of fraud. Additionally, biometric data is not easily revocable, meaning
that once it is compromised, it is difficult to change or replace.

Another potential drawback of biometric authentication is the risk of false positives.
While biometric systems are designed to be highly accurate, there is still a small
chance of false positives, where the system incorrectly identifies an individual
as someone else. This can lead to access being granted to unauthorized users,
compromising security.

Moreover, biometric authentication systems can be expensive to implement and maintain.
The hardware and software required for biometric authentication can be costly, and
there may be additional costs associated with training and support. This can be a
barrier to adoption for some organizations, especially smaller ones with limited
resources.

\subsection{The ugly}

\hspace{1 em} One of the biggest challenges facing biometric authentication is 
the risk of security vulnerabilities. While biometric systems are designed to be
secure, they are not immune to attacks. For example, biometric data can be stolen
or spoofed, leading to unauthorized access. Additionally, biometric systems can
be susceptible to other forms of cyber attacks, such as malware or phishing.

Another challenge is the potential for bias and discrimination in biometric systems.
Biometric data is often used to make important decisions, such as granting access
to a building or verifying a person's identity. If the biometric system is biased
or inaccurate, it can lead to unfair outcomes, such as denying access to certain

There are some legal and ethical concerns surrounding biometric authentication.
For example, there are questions about who owns and controls biometric data, and
how it can be used. There are also concerns about the potential for biometric data
to be used for surveillance or tracking purposes, infringing on individuals' privacy
and civil liberties.

Finally, there are concerns about the reliability and accuracy of biometric systems.
While biometric authentication is generally considered to be more secure and reliable
than traditional methods, it is not foolproof. Factors such as environmental conditions,
user behavior, and system errors can all affect the accuracy of biometric systems,
leading to false positives or false negatives.
