\hspace{1 em}There are various biometric systems, components, and methods that are used to capture, process, 
and analyze biometric data. These systems are designed to identify and authenticate individuals based on their
 unique biological traits or behavioral patterns. In this section, we explore the different types of 
 biometric systems, the components that make up these systems, and the methods used to extract and analyze 
 biometric data.

\subsection{Biometric sensors}
Biometric sensors are specialized devices that capture and analyze unique physiological or behavioral 
characteristics of individuals for authentication purposes. These sensors are designed to detect and 
measure specific biometric traits, such as fingerprints, iris patterns, facial features, voice patterns, 
or hand geometry.
